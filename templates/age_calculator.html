    <h2>How Age is Calculated</h2>
    <p>Age calculation involves determining the difference between the current date and your date of birth. Here are some key components of how age is calculated:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Years:</strong> Calculated by subtracting the year of birth from the current year. If your birthday hasn't occurred yet this year, one year is subtracted from the total.</li>
        <li><strong>Months:</strong> The difference in months is determined by comparing the birth month to the current month. Adjustments are made if the current day is earlier than the birth day.</li>
        <li><strong>Days:</strong> Calculated by counting the days from the last birthday or the last month until the current date.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds:</strong> These are calculated by multiplying the total years, months, and days by the corresponding number of days, hours, minutes, or seconds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, if you were born on January 1, 1990, and today's date is August 9, 2024, your age would be 34 years, 7 months, and 8 days.</p>
    <p>Using the above information, you can accurately determine your age in various formats. This calculation is beneficial for various purposes, including planning and reflecting on life's milestones.</p>

    <h2>Beauty and Anti-Aging Tips</h2>
    <p>Maintaining a youthful appearance and healthy skin is important at any age. Here are some tips to help you look and feel your best:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hydrate:</strong> Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated and flush out toxins. Proper hydration can help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Diet:</strong> Eat a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Foods like berries, nuts, and leafy greens can support skin health and combat signs of aging.</li>
        <li><strong>Sun Protection:</strong> Apply sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher daily, even on cloudy days. UV rays can cause premature aging, including wrinkles and dark spots.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Use a good moisturizer suited to your skin type to keep your skin soft and supple. Look for ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides for added hydration.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> Engage in regular physical activity to improve blood circulation and support overall skin health. Exercise can also help manage stress, which impacts the appearance of your skin.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Quality Sleep:</strong> Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night. Adequate rest is essential for skin repair and regeneration.</li>
        <li><strong>Skin Care Routine:</strong> Follow a consistent skincare routine that includes cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing. Consider incorporating products with retinoids, peptides, and antioxidants for added benefits.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce Stress:</strong> Practice stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises. Chronic stress can contribute to premature aging and skin issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Smoking:</strong> Smoking accelerates the aging process and can lead to wrinkles and a dull complexion. Quitting smoking can improve the appearance of your skin and overall health.</li>
