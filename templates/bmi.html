    <h3>Understanding Your BMI</h3>
    <p>BMI is a widely used measure to understand if your weight is in a healthy range compared to your height. While BMI is a useful starting point, it doesn't consider muscle mass, bone density, or overall body composition. Therefore, it's essential to use BMI as one part of a more comprehensive health assessment. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and consulting with healthcare professionals can help you achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>
    
    <h3>How BMI is Calculated</h3>
    <p>BMI is calculated using the following formula:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Metric System:</strong> BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li><strong>Imperial System:</strong> BMI = (weight (lbs) / (height (in))<sup>2</sup>) x 703</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, if you weigh 70 kilograms and are 1.75 meters tall, your BMI is calculated as follows:</p>
    <p>BMI = 70 / (1.75 x 1.75) = 22.86</p>
    <p>If you weigh 154 pounds and are 68 inches tall, your BMI is:</p>
    <p>BMI = (154 / (68 x 68)) x 703 = 23.41</p>
    <p>These calculations help determine your weight status and provide a guideline for understanding your overall health. Always consider other factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and overall body composition when evaluating your BMI.</p>

    <h3>BMI Categories</h3>
    <p>Here is a general BMI scale to help you understand your result:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Underweight:</strong> BMI &lt; 18.5</li>
        <li><strong>Normal weight:</strong> 18.5 ≤ BMI &lt; 24.9</li>
        <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> 25 ≤ BMI &lt; 29.9</li>
        <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> BMI ≥ 30</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Health and Exercise Tips</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced Diet:</strong> Eat a variety of nutrient-dense foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid excessive intake of processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats.</li>
